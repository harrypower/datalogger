{"register device":{"sensor_name":"mbedA","ip":"192.168.0.126","port":"4445","method":"value","quantity":8},"register data":{"name":"temperature","type":"INTEGER","name":"humidity","type":"INTEGER","name":"co2raw","type":"INTEGER","name":"nh3raw","type":"INTEGER","name":"co2cal","type":"INTEGER","name":"nh3cal","type":"INTEGER","name":"co2rel","type":"INTEGER","name":"nh3rel","type":"INTEGER"}}

The above json is an example of how you register a device with this datalogging project.
The above json could be put into a file to register from.  
sensor_name is the table name of the device that will be logged.
The name and type would be fields of the table sensor_name that is given.
The types allowed are the same as sqlite3 TEXT, INTEGER, REAL.  The table will have a row and dtime field also.
method is the value used in the http request as follows(for data retreaval): 
192.168.0.125:4446/value 
Normaly this json will come from the sensor it self from a wget request or some other method that is used to create the tables in database!
Note there are some restrictions on the names that can be used for sensor_name, name and type.  The normal sqlite3 table name restrictions!
