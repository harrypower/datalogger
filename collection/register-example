The above xml is an example of how you register a device with this datalogging project.
The above xml could be put into a file as is to register.  
sensor_name is the table name of the data that will be logged.
The data_name and data_type would be a table fieled of the data_type.
The data types allowed are the same as sqlite3 TEXT, INTEGER, REAL.  The table will have a row and dtime field also.
method is the value used in the http request as follows: 
192.168.0.125:4446/value 
Normaly this xml will come from the sensor it self and that is how i intend to register devices!
